After searching the Web, I couldn't find the correct and deterministic solution to this problem. The first time I solved this problem goes back to 2017.

This DPDA problem is very fundamental in theoretical computer science.

I'm sending the solution to Github along with "Visual DPDA Machine Design" and "Simulation (working program) of the Design"

* DPDA Machine Design.png is showing the visual design
* Auto Testing.html is the simulation of the machine which the DPDA design is implemented. 
  This file is also the testing file. Any string or all combination of strings can be tested.
