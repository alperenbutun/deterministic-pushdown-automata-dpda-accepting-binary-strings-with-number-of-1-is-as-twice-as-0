Deterministic Pushdown Automaton (DPDA) Accepting Binary Strings With Number of 1s is as Twice as 0

**Update (April 10, 2024):**
It's a fact that 1,1/E condition defined for TOP LEFT NODE never happens

After searching the Web, I couldn't find the correct and deterministic solution to this problem. The first time I solved this problem is 2017.

This dpda problem is very fundamental in theoretical computer science.

I'm sending the deterministic solution to Github along with "Visual DPDA Machine Design" and "Simulation of the Design"

* DPDA Machine Design is the visual representation of the dpda design
* AutoTesting.html is the simulation of the machine which the dpda design is implemented. 
  This file is also the testing file. Any string or all combination of strings can be tested.
