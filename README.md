I searched the Web and couldn't find the correct and deterministic solution to this problem. I think the problem is very fundamental in theoretical computing.
I'm sending the solution to Github along with "Visual PDA Machine Design" and "Simulation(working program) of the Design"

There are two files in total.
* PDA Machine.png is the machine design
* Auto Testing.html is the machine's simulation which the deterministic PDA design implemented. This file is also testing file. Any string or all combination of strings   can be tested. To run this file, please click the DEMO link above.
